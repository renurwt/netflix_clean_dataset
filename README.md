1.Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a real-world Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. 
The goal was to improve data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing 
text and categorical values, fixing date formats, and documenting data quality issues.

 2.Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset)
- Format: CSV
- Rows: ~8,800
- Columns: 12

3.Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub

4.Data Cleaning Steps

1. Imported the dataset and saved it as raw data.
2. Froze header rows and explored the dataset structure.
3. Identified missing values using filters and conditional formatting.
4. Created a backup copy before making changes.
5. Removed duplicate records using unique identifiers.
6. Cleaned text columns using TRIM, PROPER, and UPPER functions.
7. Standardized categorical values (Movie / TV Show, ratings).
8. Fixed date formats and numeric columns.
9. Added a `Data_Quality_Notes` column to document data issues.
10. Created a final cleaned dataset and exported it as CSV.
